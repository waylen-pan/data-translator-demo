<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When interacting with Claude, think of it as a brilliant but very new employee (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. Like any new employee, Claude does not have context on your norms, styles, guidelines, or preferred ways of working.
The more precisely you explain what you want, the better Claude's response will be.

<Tip>**The golden rule of clear prompting**<br/>Show your prompt to a colleague, ideally someone who has minimal context on the task, and ask them to follow the instructions. If they're confused, Claude will likely be too.</Tip>

## How to be clear, contextual, and specific

- **Give Claude contextual information:** Just like you might be able to better perform on a task if you knew more context, Claude will perform better if it has more contextual information. Some examples of contextual information:
    - What the task results will be used for
    - What audience the output is meant for
    - What workflow the task is a part of, and where this task belongs in that workflow
    - The end goal of the task, or what a successful task completion looks like
- **Be specific about what you want Claude to do:** For example, if you want Claude to output only code and nothing else, say so.
- **Provide instructions as sequential steps:** Use numbered lists or bullet points to better ensure that Claude carries out the task the exact way you want it to.

### Examples

    <section title="Example: Anonymizing customer feedback">

    Notice that Claude still makes mistakes in the unclear prompting example, such as leaving in a customer's name.

    | Role | Unclear Prompt | Clear Prompt |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | User | Please remove all personally identifiable information from these customer feedback messages: \{\{FEEDBACK_DATA\}\} | Your task is to anonymize customer feedback for our quarterly review.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/>1.

# Use examples (multishot prompting) to guide Claude's behavior

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

Examples are your secret weapon shortcut for getting Claude to generate exactly what you need. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can dramatically improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of Claude's outputs.
This technique, known as few-shot or multishot prompting, is particularly effective for tasks that require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

<Tip>**Power up your prompts**: Include 3-5 diverse, relevant examples to show Claude exactly what you want. More examples = better performance, especially for complex tasks.</Tip>

## Why use examples?

- **Accuracy**: Examples reduce misinterpretation of instructions.
- **Consistency**: Examples enforce uniform structure and style.
- **Performance**: Well-chosen examples boost Claude's ability to handle complex tasks.

## Crafting effective examples

For maximum effectiveness, make sure that your examples are:
- **Relevant**: Your examples mirror your actual use case.
- **Diverse**: Your examples cover edge cases and potential challenges, and vary enough that Claude doesn't inadvertently pick up on unintended patterns.
- **Clear**: Your examples are wrapped in `<example>` tags (if multiple, nested within `<examples>` tags) for structure.

<Tip>Ask Claude to evaluate your examples for relevance, diversity, or clarity. Or have Claude generate more examples based on your initial set.</Tip>
<section title="Example: Analyzing customer feedback">

    Notice that in the "no examples" version, Claude does not list multiple options for each category, despite its written analysis indicating that there are multiple categories for certain feedback. It also includes a long explanation when we may not want it to.

    | Role | No Examples | With Examples |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | User | Analyze this customer feedback and categorize the issues. Use these categories: UI/UX, Performance, Feature Request, Integration, Pricing, and Other. Also rate the sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and priority (High/Medium/Low).<br/><br/>Here is the feedback: \{\{FEEDBACK\}\} | Our CS team is overwhelmed with unstructured feedback. Your task is to analyze feedback and categorize issues for our product and engineering teams. Use these categories: UI/UX, Performance, Feature Request, Integration, Pricing, and Other. Also rate the sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and priority (High/Medium/Low). Here is an example:<br/><br/>\<example><br/>Input: The new dashboard is a mess! It takes forever to load, and I can't find the export button. Fix this ASAP!<br/>Category: UI/UX, Performance<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High\</example><br/><br/>Now, analyze this feedback: \{\{FEEDBACK\}\} |
    | Assistant (Claude's response) | Here's the analysis of the customer feedback:<br/><br/>Issue: UI/UX<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/>The customer is frustrated with the new dashboard design, which they find cluttered and slow to load. They specifically call out the missing "export" button, which is likely a critical feature. This issue needs to be addressed as a high priority.<br/><br/>Issue: Integration<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Medium<br/>The customer is pleased with the existing Salesforce integration but would like to see support for Hubspot as well. This is a feature request that could be considered for a future product update.<br/><br/>Issue: Pricing<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/>The customer finds the pricing to be unreasonable, especially for the basic features. They are threatening to switch to a competitor, so this is a high-priority issue that needs to be reviewed.<br/><br/>Issue: Performance<br/>Sentiment Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/>The customer is experiencing critical issues with the mobile app, where large file uploads consistently result in crashes. This is a significant problem that impacts the customer's ability to use the product effectively and should be addressed as a high priority.<br/><br/>Issue: UI/UX<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Low<br/>The customer is overall satisfied with the product, specifically calling out the intuitive UI and excellent customer support. This is a positive piece of feedback that does not require any immediate action. | Here's the analysis of the customer feedback:<br/><br/>1. The new dashboard is a mess! It takes forever to load, and I can't find the export button. Fix this ASAP!<br/>Category: UI/UX, Performance<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/><br/>2. Love the Salesforce integration! But it'd be great if you could add Hubspot too.<br/>Category: Integration, Feature Request<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Medium<br/><br/>3. Your pricing is ridiculous! $99/mo for basic features? I'm switching to Competitor X.<br/>Category: Pricing<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/><br/>4. The mobile app keeps crashing when I try to upload large files (>50MB). This is critical for our field agents.<br/>Category: Performance<br/>Sentiment: Negative<br/>Priority: High<br/><br/>5. Overall, I'm happy with the product. The UI is intuitive, and the customer support is top-notch. Keep it up!<br/>Category: UI/UX, Other (Customer Support)<br/>Sentiment: Positive<br/>Priority: Low |

# Chain complex prompts for stronger performance

---

<Note>
While these tips apply broadly to all Claude models, you can find prompting tips specific to extended thinking models [here](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/extended-thinking-tips).
</Note>

When working with complex tasks, Claude can sometimes drop the ball if you try to handle everything in a single prompt. Chain of thought (CoT) prompting is great, but what if your task has multiple distinct steps that each require in-depth thought?

Enter prompt chaining: breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

## Why chain prompts?

1. **Accuracy**: Each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors.
2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks mean clearer instructions and outputs.
3. **Traceability**: Easily pinpoint and fix issues in your prompt chain.

***

## When to chain prompts

Use prompt chaining for multi-step tasks like research synthesis, document analysis, or iterative content creation. When a task involves multiple transformations, citations, or instructions, chaining prevents Claude from dropping or mishandling steps. 

**Remember:** Each link in the chain gets Claude's full attention!

<Tip>**Debugging tip**: If Claude misses a step or performs poorly, isolate that step in its own prompt. This lets you fine-tune problematic steps without redoing the entire task.</Tip>

***

## How to chain prompts

1. **Identify subtasks**: Break your task into distinct, sequential steps.
2. **Structure with XML for clear handoffs**: Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts.
3. **Have a single-task goal**: Each subtask should have a single, clear objective.
4. **Iterate**: Refine subtasks based on Claude's performance.

### Example chained workflows:
- **Multi-step analysis**: See the legal and business examples below.
- **Content creation pipelines**: Research → Outline → Draft → Edit → Format.
- **Data processing**: Extract → Transform → Analyze → Visualize.
- **Decision-making**: Gather info → List options → Analyze each → Recommend.
- **Verification loops**: Generate content → Review → Refine → Re-review.

<Tip>**Optimization tip**: For tasks with independent subtasks (like analyzing multiple docs), create separate prompts and run them in parallel for speed.</Tip>

### Advanced: Self-correction chains

You can chain prompts to have Claude review its own work! This catches errors and refines outputs, especially for high-stakes tasks.

  <section title="Example: Self-correcting research summary">

    #### Prompt 1
    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | Summarize this medical research paper.<br/><br/>\\{\{RESEARCH_PAPER}}\</paper><br/><br/>Focus on methodology, findings, and clinical implications. |
    | Assistant<br/>\{\{SUMMARY}} | Methodology: Double-blind RCT with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received novel GLP-1/GIP dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received standard GLP-1 agonist. 24-week trial, primary endpoint: HbA1c reduction.<br/><br/>Findings:<br/>- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br/>- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br/>- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br/>- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br/>- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br/><br/>Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, no serious events attributed to treatment.<br/><br/>Clinical Implications: Dual agonist shows superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard therapy. Could be a game-changer, especially for obese diabetics. |
    
    #### Prompt 2
    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | Your task is to provide feedback on a research paper summary. Here is a summary of a medical research paper:<br/>\<summary><br/>\{\{SUMMARY\}\}<br/>\</summary><br/><br/>Here is the research paper:<br/>\<br/>\{\{RESEARCH_PAPER\}\}<br/>\</paper><br/><br/>Review this summary for accuracy, clarity, and completeness on a graded A-F scale. |
    | Assistant<br/>\{\{FEEDBACK}} | 1. Accuracy: A<br/>   - Correctly reported key stats: HbA1c reductions, weight loss.<br/>   - Accurately noted safety profile and lack of serious adverse events.<br/>   - Assertion of "game-changer" is justified by significantly better outcomes.<br/><br/>2. Clarity: A-<br/>   - Concise and well-structured with clear sections.<br/>   - Good use of comparative language (e.g., "up 3% from Q1") for context.<br/>   - Minor issue: Acronyms like "RCT," "GLP-1," and "GIP" not defined. Consider spelling out first use.<br/><br/>3. Completeness: B+<br/>   - Covers all requested areas: methodology, findings, clinical implications.<br/>   - Missing: Baseline characteristics of groups (were they well-matched?).<br/>   - Missing: Any secondary endpoints (e.g., blood pressure, lipids).<br/>   - Consider: Long-term implications or need for further research.<br/><br/>Overall, the summary is accurate and clear, providing key insights for a quick grasp of the study. To elevate to A+, define acronyms, mention group baseline stats, note any secondary outcomes, and briefly touch on the need for long-term studies. |
    
     #### Prompt 3
    | Role | Content |
    | ---- | ------- |
    | User | Your task is to improve a paper summary given feedback. Here is the first draft of a medical research paper:<br/>\<summary><br/>\{\{SUMMARY\}\}<br/>\</summary><br/><br/>Here is the research paper:<br/>\<br/>\{\{RESEARCH_PAPER\}\}<br/>\</paper><br/><br/>Here is the feedback:<br/>\<feedback><br/>\{\{FEEDBACK\}\}<br/>\</feedback><br/><br/>Update the summary based on the feedback. |
    | Assistant | Methodology: Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 500 Type 2 diabetes patients. Group A (n=250) received a novel glucagon-like peptide-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GLP-1/GIP) dual agonist; Group B (n=250) received a standard GLP-1 agonist. The 24-week trial's primary endpoint was HbA1c reduction. Groups were well-matched for age, BMI, and baseline HbA1c.<br/><br/>Findings:<br/>- Group A: 1.8% mean HbA1c reduction<br/>- Group B: 1.1% mean HbA1c reduction<br/>- 68% of Group A vs. 52% of Group B achieved HbA1c \<7%<br/>- Group A: 5.2kg mean weight loss<br/>- Group B: 3.1kg mean weight loss<br/><br/>Secondary endpoints showed improvements in blood pressure and lipid profiles for both groups, with Group A showing slightly better results.<br/><br/>Safety: Similar adverse event profiles, with no serious events attributed to either treatment.<br/><br/>Clinical Implications: The dual GLP-1/GIP agonist demonstrates superior glycemic control and weight loss compared to standard GLP-1 therapy. These results suggest it could be a significant advancement, particularly for obese diabetics. However, longer-term studies are needed to confirm sustained efficacy and safety, as well as to investigate potential benefits on cardiovascular outcomes. |

    | Assistant<br/>\{\{STRATEGY_DOC}} | # Multitenancy Strategy Review: SaaS Enterprise Product<br/><br/>## Executive Summary<br/>The proposed strategy demonstrates a solid foundation in scalability and security principles but has gaps in implementation details. It excels in data isolation and component-level scaling but lacks robust app-tier scaling and advanced security measures. Cost optimizations are present but may falter at high scale. With targeted enhancements, this strategy can effectively support our enterprise SaaS ambitions.<br/><br/>## Detailed Analysis<br/><br/>### 1. Scalability: B+<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Database sharding by tenant is excellent. It minimizes query latency, supports high data growth, and facilitates seamless per-tenant scaling.<br/>- Microservices architecture allows scaling individual components based on demand, crucial for handling diverse enterprise workloads.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- Shared application servers risk becoming a bottleneck. As tenant count and traffic grow, these could degrade performance across all tenants.<br/>- Absence of auto-scaling and load balancing for the app tier is a critical oversight. These are essential for handling traffic spikes without over-provisioning.<br/><br/>### 2. Security: B-<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Sharded databases provide strong tenant data isolation, mitigating risks of data leaks or unauthorized access between tenants.<br/>- JWT with short expiry and refresh tokens align with OWASP best practices, reducing token vulnerability windows.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- No mention of data encryption at rest or in transit (TLS 1.3). This is non-negotiable for enterprise data.<br/>- Key management strategy is missing. How are encryption keys, JWT secrets, and DB credentials managed and rotated?<br/>- IAM lacks depth. We need RBAC with well-defined roles, attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions, and integration with enterprise identity providers (SAML, OIDC).<br/><br/>### 3. Cost-effectiveness: B<br/><br/>Strengths:<br/>- Shared app servers reduce idle capacity costs, good for steady-state traffic.<br/>- Serverless for infrequent tasks (e.g., reporting) is smart; pay only when these resources are used.<br/><br/>Weaknesses:<br/>- Per-tenant databases may not be cost-effective at scale compared to a well-designed multi-tenant database with robust data partitioning.<br/>- No mention of cost-saving measures like reserved instances for predictable workloads or spot instances for fault-tolerant tasks.<br/>- Lack of app-tier auto-scaling could lead to over-provisioning, increasing costs.<br/><br/>## Recommendations<br/><br/>1. **App Tier Resilience**: Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes or cloud-native services (EKS, GKE). Deploy across availability zones with a CDN for static assets.<br/><br/>2. **Security Hardening**:<br/>   a. Encrypt data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3).<br/>   b. Use a managed KMS (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for key management.<br/>   c. Enhance IAM with RBAC, ABAC, and SAML/OIDC for enterprise SSO.<br/><br/>3. **Cost Optimization**:<br/>   a. Evaluate columnar multi-tenant DB (e.g., Snowflake) vs. sharding at scale.<br/>   b. Use reserved instances for app servers, spot instances for non-critical workloads.<br/>   c. Implement proactive monitoring and right-sizing to avoid overprovisioning.<br/><br/>4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Before full implementation, conduct a PoC with a high-scale simulation:<br/>   a. Test sharded DB vs. optimized multi-tenant DB for cost and performance.<br/>   b. Stress-test app tier with simulated enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br/>   c. Conduct third-party security audit, focusing on data isolation and access controls.<br/><br/>With these enhancements, our multi-tenancy strategy will be enterprise-grade: scalable, secure, and cost-effective. The PoC will validate our design choices and instill confidence in our enterprise clients. |

    | User | Grade this strategy review document for clarity, actionability, and alignment with enterprise priorities. <br/><br/>\<br/>\{\{PRIORITIES}}<br/>\</priorities><br/><br/>\<strategy_doc><br/>\{\{STRATEGY_DOC}}<br/>\</strategy_doc> |
    | Assistant | 1. Clarity: A<br/>   + Clear structure with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations.<br/>   + Analysis uses a grading system (B+, B-) for quick grasp of strengths/weaknesses.<br/>   + Technical terms (RBAC, ABAC, TLS) are explained or contextualized, aiding non-technical leadership.<br/>   + Visual aids (bullet points, indentation) enhance readability.<br/><br/>2. Actionability: A-<br/>   + Recommendations are specific and technical (e.g., "Implement auto-scaling with Kubernetes").<br/>   + PoC plan with clear objectives provides a roadmap.<br/>   + Missing: Timelines, resource requirements, or team assignments for each recommendation.<br/>   + Consider: Add a "Next Steps" section with immediate actions, roles, and a high-level timeline.<br/><br/>3. Enterprise Alignment: A+<br/>   + Directly addresses enterprise priorities:<br/>     - Scalability: Discusses handling enterprise-level traffic spikes.<br/>     - Security: Focuses on data isolation, encryption, and enterprise IAM.<br/>     - Cost: Strategies align with enterprise FinOps (reserved instances, right-sizing).<br/>   + PoC with "high-scale simulation" and security audit shows commitment to enterprise-grade quality.<br/>   + Language resonates with enterprise concerns: "unacceptable risk," "enterprise-grade," "instill confidence."<br/><br/>Overall, the document excels in clarity and enterprise alignment. The actionability is strong but could be elevated to A+ with a "Next Steps" section. The technical depth, coupled with clear explanations, makes this highly effective for both technical and non-technical leadership. Great work! |
